Banking Sector Outlook?**\nBanking holding up and leading in the risk-on run but breadth is narrow; YKBNK (1W: +3.10% | 1M: +7.18%) ABOVE TREND, AKBNK (1W: +2.04% | 1M: +1.29%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +1.52% | 1M: +1.52%) ABOVE TREND — selectively add on strength but watch 2W weakness in quant screens.\n\n**8. Industrial Sector Outlook?**\nHeavy Industry is the clear tactical winner: EREGL (1W: +8.65% | 1M: +14.68%) ABOVE TREND, KRDMD (1W: +6.27% | 1M: +8.54%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: +2.79% | 1M: +0.94%) ABOVE TREND — momentum favors cyclicals; watch FROTO (1W: -4.45% | 1M: +3.39%) CORRECTION for mean-reversion.\n\n**9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?**\nMixed but positive this week: TRMET (1W: +8.21% | 1M: +10.98%) ABOVE TREND, TRALT (1W: +6.83% | 1M: +2.95%) ABOVE TREND, SASA (1W: +2.07% | 1M: -5.00%) RECOVERY; monitor TUPRS (1W: -1.40% | 1M: -12.04%) BELOW TREND for continued weakness.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n**10. Portfolio Recommendation?**\nRisk-on tactical stance: overweight Heavy Industry and selective Banking names, add conviction longs in EREGL and TRMET; underweight/trim Retail, Tech and weak holdings like TKFEN and KONTR while keeping stops tight given narrow breadth.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n**11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?**\nEREGL (1W: +8.65% | 1M: +14.68%) ABOVE TREND for momentum continuation; TRMET (1W: +8.21% | 1M: +10.98%) ABOVE TREND on commodity sensitivity; TKFEN (1W: -13.69% | 1M: -5.21%) BELOW TREND as a watchlist for oversold bounce; TCELL (1W: -5.70% | 1M: -1.28%) BELOW TREND for any catalyst-driven reversal.\n\n**12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?**\nHeavy Industry and Banking for upside leadership; Energy & Chemicals for catalyst-driven moves and divergences between names.\n\n**13. Key Levels & Triggers?**\nWatch XU100 reaction to 20-day trend and weekly close — bullish continuation requires holds above the short-term moving average and rising breadth; key catalysts: domestic CPI and CBRT commentary, USD/TRY direction, Q1 earnings from banks and cyclicals, and global risk sentiment.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility RISK-ON with narrow participation: Heavy Industry and select Banks lead while Tech, Retail and Construction lag. Trade tactically long EREGL/TRMET and selective banks, trim weak retail/tech holdings and monitor macro catalysts (CBRT, CPI, USD/TRY) for regime shift."
