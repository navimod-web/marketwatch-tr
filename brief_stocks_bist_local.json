TRMET (1W: +12.60% | 1M: +15.15%) ABOVE TREND and TRALT (1W: +11.40% | 1M: +11.50%) ABOVE TREND lead, while SASA (1W: -7.95% | 1M: -2.80%) BELOW TREND and HEKTS (1W: -7.20% | 1M: +0.31%) CORRECTION lag.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nNeutral stance — favor selective long exposure to high-quality banks and momentum industrial/energy winners, trim vulnerable transportation and smaller cyclical names. Keep position sizing disciplined and maintain a cash buffer for rotation-driven opportunities.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nWatch EREGL (1W: +8.73% | 1M: +14.64%) ABOVE TREND for follow-through, TRMET (1W: +12.60% | 1M: +15.15%) ABOVE TREND for energy momentum, ENKAI (1W: +2.60% | 1M: +22.07%) ABOVE TREND for construction flow, KONTR (1W: -10.29% | 1M: +3.65%) CORRECTION as a volatility play.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking for leadership confirmation and Energy & Chemicals for idiosyncratic breakout/fade risk. Monitor Transportation for further downside risk and volatility spillover.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction to global risk cues and local macro data; market is sensitive to CBRT communication, CPI prints, and oil prices as immediate catalysts. Technical triggers: watch for follow-through above recent swing highs for leaders and failure to reclaim those levels as a trigger to reduce cyclicals.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNeutral market with normal volatility but very narrow breadth; leadership concentrated in banks and select energy/heavy industrial names. Opportunities reside in high-quality banking names and momentum winners like TRMET and EREGL, while transportation, small-cap tech and select chemicals warrant defensive trimming."
