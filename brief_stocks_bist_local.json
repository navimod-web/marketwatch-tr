Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry mixed with clear winners and losers: EREGL (1W: +9.90% | 1M: +15.87%) ABOVE TREND, KRDMD (1W: +2.33% | 1M: +9.86%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: +5.10% | 1M: -4.41%) RECOVERY, VESTL (1W: -9.79% | 1M: -3.55%) BELOW TREND, ARCLK (1W: -8.26% | 1M: +5.68%) CORRECTION.\n\n9.

Portfolio Recommendation?\nRemain selective: overweight high-conviction banking names (AKBNK, YKBNK) and standout industrial/energy leaders (EREGL, TRALT, TRMET, ENKAI) while underweight Transportation, weak tech/retail laggards and single-stock names showing BELOW TREND; keep cash/hedges for breadth-driven reversals.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nTRALT (1W: +13.07% | 1M: +13.17%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +12.32% | 1M: +14.86%) ABOVE TREND, EREGL (1W: +9.90% | 1M: +15.87%) ABOVE TREND, TAVHL (1W: -11.42% | 1M: -3.76%) BELOW TREND, AKBNK (1W: +2.98% | 1M: +14.94%) ABOVE TREND.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance for leadership sustainability; Heavy Industry and Energy for continued idiosyncratic rallies versus Transportation for risk of further underperformance.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction to macro/cash flow catalysts (CBRT communication, FX moves, global risk sentiment) and technical pivots around the 20-day/50-day ranges for trend confirmation; intra-sector earnings, oil and commodity moves and regional geopolitical headlines will be immediate triggers.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNeutral volatility with extremely narrow breadth — leadership concentrated in banks and a handful of energy/industrial stocks while most sectors sit in CORRECTION or BELOW TREND. Trade selectively: own leaders with size discipline and hedge exposure to Transportation and weak Tech names."
