Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanks are the clear leadership pocket; AKBNK (1W: +3.74% | 1M: +2.98%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +3.49% | 1M: +3.49%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: +2.32% | 1M: +5.84%) ABOVE TREND — favor overweight on high-quant names (VAKBN, HALKB).\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry showing cyclical rebound: EREGL (1W: +6.99% | 1M: +12.92%) ABOVE TREND, KRDMD (1W: +3.92% | 1M: +6.14%) ABOVE TREND, VESTL (1W: +3.24% | 1M: -1.95%) RECOVERY — maintain exposure to export-sensitive steel and auto names, trim winners into strength.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nMixed and selective: TRMET (1W: +7.88% | 1M: +10.65%) ABOVE TREND and TRALT (1W: +5.69% | 1M: +1.86%) ABOVE TREND outperform, while TUPRS (1W: -2.48% | 1M: -13.00%) BELOW TREND and HEKTS (1W: -6.97% | 1M: -9.17%) BELOW TREND lag — prefer commodity-hedged plays and avoid structurally weak chemical names.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk-on, favour overweight Banks and selective Heavy Industry/energy momentum names; underweight Retail, Transport and weak Tech/holding names. Use realized low volatility to add exposure on pullbacks and trim into rallies; keep cash buffer for event risk.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nEREGL (1W: +6.99% | 1M: +12.92%) ABOVE TREND for momentum continuation, TRMET (1W: +7.88% | 1M: +10.65%) ABOVE TREND for follow-through, TUPRS (1W: -2.48% | 1M: -13.00%) BELOW TREND as a value/beat-or-miss catalyst, AKBNK (1W: +3.74% | 1M: +2.98%) ABOVE TREND for bank flows.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance for breadth confirmation, Heavy Industry for continued cyclical leadership, Energy & Chemicals for commodity-driven divergence.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 directional cues around the 20-day and 50-day moving averages for risk-on extension versus pullback; key catalysts: CBRT commentary, Q4 earnings flow, oil price moves and global risk sentiment (US yields/EM flows).\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRisk-on regime on low volatility with mixed breadth — banks and heavy industry are leading while retail, transport and select tech names lag. Trade selectively: overweight high-quant banks and cyclical industrials, avoid weak chemical/retail names and use pullbacks to add while trimming into strength."
