Banking Sector Outlook?\nSelective overweight on large caps that are confirming strength: AKBNK (1W: +2.04% | 1M: +1.29%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +1.52% | 1M: +1.52%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: +0.54% | 1M: +4.00%) ABOVE TREND — banks look defensive-cyclical in this low-vol backdrop.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy Industry the clear cyclical leader: EREGL (1W: +8.65% | 1M: +14.68%) ABOVE TREND, KRDMD (1W: +6.27% | 1M: +8.54%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: +2.79% | 1M: +0.94%) ABOVE TREND; watch FROTO (1W: -4.45% | 1M: +3.39%) CORRECTION for stock-specific pullbacks.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nMixed: TRMET (1W: +8.21% | 1M: +10.98%) ABOVE TREND and TRALT (1W: +6.83% | 1M: +2.95%) ABOVE TREND driving the group while TUPRS (1W: -1.40% | 1M: -12.04%) BELOW TREND and HEKTS (1W: -7.88% | 1M: -10.06%) BELOW TREND remain weak.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nLean into RISK-ON: overweight Heavy Industry and selective large banks, trim exposure to Technology, Retail and Transportation where breadth is weak; use TKFEN and other deep pullbacks to add size selectively if fundamentals hold.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nEREGL (1W: +8.65% | 1M: +14.68%) ABOVE TREND for continuation, TRMET (1W: +8.21% | 1M: +10.98%) ABOVE TREND on momentum, AKBNK (1W: +2.04% | 1M: +1.29%) ABOVE TREND for bank-flow confirmation, TKFEN (1W: -13.69% | 1M: -5.21%) BELOW TREND as a volatility play.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nHeavy Industry to confirm leadership, Banking to show whether breadth broadens beyond top names, and Transportation to monitor for spillover risk or mean-reversion opportunities.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 behavior around the recent 1-week trading range — a break above the 1-month highs would confirm expansion while a slip back below short-term support would flip momentum; watch global risk tone, CB communication, and energy/commodity price moves as primary catalysts (vol: 23.9%).\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK-ON tape with low volatility but narrow participation: Heavy Industry and large banks leading while tech, retail and holdings lag. Trade with risk-on bias but respect single-stock volatility — use dips in laggards and profit-take on short-term winners."
