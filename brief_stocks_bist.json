Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanks leading the rally; prioritize large-cap lenders: AKBNK (1W: +7.80% | 1M: +15.73%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +4.27% | 1M: +9.74%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: +2.39% | 1M: +21.72%) ABOVE TREND. Balance sheet resilience and rate outlook support further rotation into the sector.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry mixed but constructive: TOASO (1W: +6.34% | 1M: +18.78%) ABOVE TREND, EREGL (1W: +1.37% | 1M: +15.42%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: +5.53% | 1M: -7.87%) RECOVERY — watch earnings/capex signals for sustainment.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nSelective strength: TRMET (1W: +9.93% | 1M: +18.89%) ABOVE TREND, TUPRS (1W: +2.87% | 1M: -2.12%) RECOVERY, PETKM (1W: -1.33% | 1M: +7.37%) CORRECTION. Commodity price moves and FX will drive leadership within the group.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk-on stance: overweight Banking & selected cyclicals (autos, construction) and trim Transportation/weak energy names; keep some cash to add on short-term pullbacks. Stay size-aware given narrow leadership despite broad sector gains.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nVAKBN (1W: +11.29% | 1M: +23.30%) ABOVE TREND; AKBNK (1W: +7.80% | 1M: +15.73%) ABOVE TREND; TRMET (1W: +9.93% | 1M: +18.89%) ABOVE TREND; ENKAI (quant leader) (1W: strong | 1M: strong) ABOVE TREND; TOASO (1W: +6.34% | 1M: +18.78%) ABOVE TREND.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance and Construction & REIT for extension of the rally; Transportation for potential downside continuation or mean reversion. Monitor Energy & Chemicals for dispersion around commodity moves.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch market internals and 20-day MA behavior for signs of exhaustion; primary triggers: domestic rate commentary, FX moves, global risk sentiment and commodity price shocks. A sustained loss of the 20-day structure or weakening breadth would flip the tape from risk-on.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility, broad risk-on market led by banks and cyclicals with strong quant confirmations; VAKBN, TRMET and large banks are key leaders. Main risk: stretched positioning and a transport/energy pullback that could test breadth — manage weights and keep tactical dry powder."
