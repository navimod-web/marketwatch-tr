Expect sector moves to track oil/chemical spreads and export demand.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n**10. Portfolio Recommendation?**\nOverweight cyclical leaders in Construction, Transportation and Retail while trimming lagging bank/holding exposure; maintain size discipline on names up sharply. Use pullbacks in strong names (EREGL, TKFEN, SISE) to add and avoid chasing AKBNK-style one-week capitulations.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n**11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?**\nTKFEN (1W: +11.99% | 1M: +17.36%) ABOVE TREND for follow-through momentum; EREGL (1W: +8.93% | 1M: +21.65%) ABOVE TREND for cyclicals; TUPRS (1W: -4.27% | 1M: +11.40%) CORRECTION for commodity/earnings sensitivity; AKBNK (1W: -6.05% | 1M: +15.79%) CORRECTION as a liquidity/flow monitor. These will signal whether rotation or broadening of the rally continues.\n\n**12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?**\nConstruction & REIT and Transportation for leadership confirmation, and Banking for signs of mean-reversion or further risk-off within financials. Momentum in Energy (SISE/GUBRF) will be a key tell on commodity-driven upside.\n\n**13. Key Levels & Triggers?**\nWatch XU100 reaction around near-term technical support/resistance and domestic liquidity flows; catalysts include Turkish monetary policy commentary, FX moves, oil and global risk sentiment. Monitor corporate earnings/updates from large caps and weekly foreign flows as triggers for rotation or profit-taking.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRisk-on market with low volatility and broad sector participation; cyclicals (Construction, Heavy Industry, Transportation, Retail) lead while banks and holdings lag. Opportunity: add proven momentum on pullbacks; risk: concentrated one-week reversals in financials and commodity-sensitive names."
