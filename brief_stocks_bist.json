Banking Sector Outlook?**\nBanking mixed with profit-taking: AKBNK (1W: +0.13% | 1M: +7.12%) ABOVE TREND but GARAN (1W: -1.73% | 1M: +5.20%) CORRECTION, ISCTR (1W: -0.34% | 1M: +4.89%) CORRECTION, YKBNK (1W: -2.95% | 1M: +3.13%) CORRECTION — watch earnings and NIM commentary.\n\n**8. Industrial Sector Outlook?**\nHeavy Industry bifurcated: ASELS (1W: +12.74% | 1M: +42.03%) ABOVE TREND and FROTO (1W: +2.70% | 1M: +4.13%) ABOVE TREND lead, while VESTL (1W: -4.20% | 1M: -11.95%) BELOW TREND signals selective exposure.\n\n**9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?**\nEnergy mixed — TUPRS (1W: +4.20% | 1M: +5.47%) ABOVE TREND and TRMET (1W: +4.30% | 1M: +20.22%) ABOVE TREND outperform, but SASA (1W: -19.11% | 1M: -17.42%) BELOW TREND and HEKTS (1W: -7.84% | 1M: -7.84%) BELOW TREND highlight event risk.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n**10. Portfolio Recommendation?**\nRisk-on stance: overweight Retail & Food and selective industrials (ASELS, FROTO, TOASO), overweight high-quality energy names with momentum (TRALT, TUPRS); trim weak cyclicals and avoid names with idiosyncratic selloffs (SASA, KONTR). Keep cash buffer for volatility spikes and use stops on recent runners.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n**11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?**\nASELS (1W: +12.74% | 1M: +42.03%) ABOVE TREND for continuation or pullback, BIMAS (1W: +12.12% | 1M: +16.47%) ABOVE TREND for retail momentum, SASA (1W: -19.11% | 1M: -17.42%) BELOW TREND for downside follow-through, TRALT (1W: +9.64% | 1M: +29.30%) ABOVE TREND for energy breakout, HALKB (1W: -4.45% | 1M: +13.48%) CORRECTION for bank rotation.\n\n**12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?**\nRetail & Food for continued rotation and sales data sensitivity, Energy & Chemicals for commodity-driven moves and earnings, Banking for rate commentary and earnings circulation.\n\n**13. Key Levels & Triggers?**\nWatch XU100 momentum around recent intraday highs and short-term moving averages for continuation; catalysts include domestic CPI, CBRT commentary, large-cap earnings, and global risk sentiment/commodity price moves — breaches or holds of near-term support should drive rebalances.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility RISK-ON tape but narrow leadership: Retail & Food and select industrials/energy are driving returns while several names suffer idiosyncratic selloffs. Favor momentum in clear winners (ASELS, BIMAS, TRALT) and manage downside risk in weak, event-driven names (SASA, KONTR) while monitoring bank corrections."
