Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanks are the market engine—AKBNK (1W: +5.38% | 1M: +10.19%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +6.25% | 1M: +5.57%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: +5.19% | 1M: +3.60%) ABOVE TREND, YKBNK (1W: +6.66% | 1M: +3.14%) ABOVE TREND and VAKBN (1W: +6.74% | 1M: -0.63%) RECOVERY show confirmed strength—overweight selective large-cap banks.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry is constructive but mixed: ASELS (1W: +3.37% | 1M: +23.83%) ABOVE TREND and TOASO (1W: +4.59% | 1M: +12.16%) ABOVE TREND lead, while VESTL (1W: -1.93% | 1M: -8.63%) BELOW TREND and ARCLK (1W: -3.05% | 1M: -1.78%) BELOW TREND warrant caution.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy shows dispersion—TRALT (1W: -4.46% | 1M: +18.46%) CORRECTION and GUBRF (quant leader) show strong longer-term scores but TUPRS (1W: -0.69% | 1M: -4.93%) BELOW TREND and SISE (1W: -1.36% | 1M: +4.54%) CORRECTION suggest rotation and sensitivity to oil/pricing news.\n\nPORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk-on stance: overweight large-cap banks and selected industrial cyclical winners (AKBNK, GARAN, ASELS, TOASO) and take profits or trim lagging holdings in holding/energy names; keep cash buffer for any short-term pullback given low vol backdrop.\n\nNEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nGARAN (1W: +6.25% | 1M: +5.57%) ABOVE TREND for earnings/loan growth sensitivity; AKBNK (1W: +5.38% | 1M: +10.19%) ABOVE TREND for macro beta; ASELS (1W: +3.37% | 1M: +23.83%) ABOVE TREND for momentum; TRALT (1W: -4.46% | 1M: +18.46%) CORRECTION as a mean-reversion candidate.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance for earnings and liquidity flows; Heavy Industry for continued cyclical leadership; Energy & Chemicals for commodity-driven volatility.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100’s 20-day moving average as near-term support and recent swing highs as resistance for continuation; catalysts: Q4 bank reports, CBRT communications, global risk sentiment and oil/commodity moves.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRisk-on environment with low volatility (13.1%) and 5/8 sectors positive; large-cap banks lead the move and are the primary overweight. Key risks: rotation into lagging energy/holding names and any surprise macro or central bank commentary that lifts volatility."
