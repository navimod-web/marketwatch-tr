Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanking is the market engine; AKBNK (1W: +5.38% | 1M: +10.19%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +6.25% | 1M: +5.57%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: +5.19% | 1M: +3.60%) ABOVE TREND, VAKBN (1W: +6.74% | 1M: -0.63%) RECOVERY — momentum intact but watch profit-taking.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry mixed: TOASO (1W: +4.59% | 1M: +12.16%) ABOVE TREND and ASELS (1W: +3.37% | 1M: +23.83%) ABOVE TREND lead, while ARCLK (1W: -3.05% | 1M: -1.78%) BELOW TREND and VESTL (1W: -1.93% | 1M: -8.63%) BELOW TREND signal divergence in cyclicals.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy underperforms on the week; TRALT (1W: -4.46% | 1M: +18.46%) CORRECTION shows profit-taking after a strong month, TUPRS (1W: -0.69% | 1M: -4.93%) BELOW TREND and SISE (1W: -1.36% | 1M: +4.54%) CORRECTION — selective opportunities but higher risk.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nOverweight Banking & Finance and select Industrials (TOASO, ASELS) for cyclical upside; trim lagging Energy/Holdings and harvest gains in high-momentum names after recent runs. Keep stops tight on names in CORRECTION or BELOW TREND.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nGARAN (1W: +6.25% | 1M: +5.57%) ABOVE TREND for continuation; TRALT (1W: -4.46% | 1M: +18.46%) CORRECTION for mean-reversion or further pullback; DOHOL (1W: -6.78% | 1M: -0.74%) BELOW TREND for downside risk; TAVHL (1W: +5.52% | 1M: +11.18%) ABOVE TREND as a transportation play.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance for leadership continuation; Transportation for reopening/cyclicals; Energy & Chemicals for dispersion and relative-value opportunities.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMarket reaction to global rates and local macro (CBRT commentary, CPI) will be the primary trigger; monitor XU100 near short-term 20-day MA for support and recent highs for resistance. Earnings updates and sector-specific catalysts (fuel margins for TUPRS, order flows for TOASO/ASELS) are near-term event risks.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRisk-on regime with low volatility and broad leadership from banks; AKBNK/GARAN/YKBNK are favored while Energy and some holdings lag. Watch TRALT and DOHOL for volatile reversals and keep downside protection on names in CORRECTION or BELOW TREND."
