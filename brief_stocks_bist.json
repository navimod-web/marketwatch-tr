Overall positive but monitor loan growth and NIM sensitivity to FX.\n\n8.

Portfolio Recommendation?\nIn this RISK-ON, low-volatility regime overweight Energy & Chemicals, Retail and selective Heavy Industry names while trimming Transportation and weak Tech. Maintain disciplined stops on names that are CORRECTION or BELOW TREND and scale into momentum leaders on confirmation.\n\nNEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nASELS (1W: +16.22% | 1M: +59.52%) ABOVE TREND for continuation or profit-taking; TUPRS (1W: +8.88% | 1M: +22.91%) ABOVE TREND on oil moves; GUBRF (1W: +9.86% | 1M: +23.47%) ABOVE TREND for sector flows; CCOLA (1W: +10.60% | 1M: +17.97%) ABOVE TREND for retail demand.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nEnergy & Chemicals for momentum and macro sensitivity, Retail & Food for domestic consumption resilience, and Heavy Industry for cyclicals and export dynamics. Watch transportation for any micro catalysts that could reverse its lag.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 responsiveness to TL FX moves, CBRT commentary and inflation prints, and global oil prices as primary triggers; domestic catalysts include earnings releases and bank loan data. Tactical risk: any pickup in volatility above ~25% would shift regime and warrant immediate de-risking.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK-ON market with low volatility and broad sector participation favors cyclicals: Energy, Retail and Heavy Industry leading. Key opportunity is riding momentum names (ASELS, TUPRS, GUBRF) while managing exposure to Transportation and names in CORRECTION/BELOW TREND."
