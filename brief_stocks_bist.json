Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nConstruction & REIT and Energy & Chemicals for continuation of leadership, plus Technology & Telecom to see if the current sell-off stabilizes or broadens.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction to year-end flows and any FX or rate headlines; catalysts include oil prices, Q4 earnings headlines and CPI/central bank commentary—confirm sector moves on volume and follow-through above recent weekly highs or below the recent weekly lows.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCalm market volatility (13.1%) masks narrow breadth (2/8), producing a CAUTION regime; leadership is concentrated in Construction & REIT and Energy while Banks, Tech and Transportation lag. Trade selectively: favor proven leaders for accumulation, trim high-beta and beaten-up names until breadth widens or volatility confirms a regime shift."
