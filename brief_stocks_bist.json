Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nConstruction & REIT (leadership narrow); Energy & Chemicals (commodity sensitivity); Technology & Telecom (continued downside risk).\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction to the month-end flows and global risk tone — sustainment above recent 1M highs would validate the narrow advance, failure to hold weekly support risks broader pullback; catalysts: TRY moves, CBT commentary, oil prices, and Q4 results/earning season flow.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility, narrow participation market (CAUTION): Construction & REIT and Energy names are driving gains while tech and transport lag hard. Maintain selective exposure to confirmed leaders, keep size discipline and a cash buffer for a potential breadth-driven reversal."
