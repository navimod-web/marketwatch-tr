Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nRetail & Food for earnings/consumption readthrough; Heavy Industry for momentum and export demand; Technology & Telecom for downside risk and possible reversal attempts.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction to a breakout above recent multi-week highs for confirmation of continuation and a drop below the last swing low for a corrective phase; near-term catalysts: domestic CPI and CBRT commentary, USD/TRY moves, and company-specific earnings/updates.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK-ON market: low vol (15.8%) and 6/8 sectors positive, favoring cyclicals. Key opportunities in ASELS, Retail names and autos; main risks are concentrated in Technology & Telecom and a handful of Energy Chemicals names (SASA, HEKTS) that could drag sentiment if weakness persists."
