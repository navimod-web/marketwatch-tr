Banking Sector Outlook?**\nBanking is the market engine — ISCTR (1W: +16.09% | 1M: +21.33%) ABOVE TREND, AKBNK (1W: +10.56% | 1M: +20.15%) ABOVE TREND, YKBNK (1W: +10.76% | 1M: +7.11%) ABOVE TREND; watch HALKB (1W: -4.59% | 1M: +12.30%) CORRECTION as a short-term weakness within the group.\n\n**8. Industrial Sector Outlook?**\nHeavy industry showing broad gains but with rotation — EREGL (1W: +4.81% | 1M: +17.29%) ABOVE TREND, FROTO (1W: +6.68% | 1M: +21.10%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: -4.43% | 1M: +23.65%) CORRECTION; selectively add on pullbacks.\n\n**9.

Portfolio Recommendation?**\nRisk-on stance: overweight Banking, Construction & REIT and Retail; add selective Energy and Heavy Industry names on dips; trim highly extended winners and reduce exposure to KONTR (1W: -0.62% | 1M: -15.40%) BELOW TREND and other single-stock froth.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n**11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?**\nISCTR (1W: +16.09% | 1M: +21.33%) ABOVE TREND, ENKAI (1W: +14.04% | 1M: +20.36%) ABOVE TREND, SISE (1W: +13.69% | 1M: +16.97%) ABOVE TREND, AKBNK (1W: +10.56% | 1M: +20.15%) ABOVE TREND, KONTR (1W: -0.62% | 1M: -15.40%) BELOW TREND.\n\n**12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?**\nConstruction & REIT, Banking & Finance, and Retail & Food for leadership continuation and earnings/flows.\n\n**13. Key Levels & Triggers?**\nWatch XU100 for continuation above recent highs (breakout confirmation) and keep pullback support near the short-term 20-day range; catalysts: CBRT communications, Q4 bank revisions, global risk appetite and oil price moves.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nLow-volatility, full-participation RISK-ON market with banks, construction and retail leading; top longs include ISCTR, ENKAI and SISE. Main risk is profit-taking in stretched names and idiosyncratic corrections (KONTR, ASELS, HALKB) — favor selective adds on dips and trim excess exposure."
