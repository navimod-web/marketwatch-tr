Key Levels & Triggers?**\nWatch XU100 reaction around recent highs for continuation; catalysts include local macro/FX flows, bank earnings and any CPI/Fed developments that would re-rate cyclicals; cut positions if leaders fail to hold weekly support or volatility spikes above ~25%.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK-ON market with low volatility and breadth led by Banking and select cyclicals; trade overweight banks, autos and defense while trimming HoldCo and Energy names showing short-term weakness. Key risk is a reversal in breadth or a volatility pickup that flips the regime quickly."
