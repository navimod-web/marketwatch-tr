Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance for leadership continuation; Heavy Industry/Auto for earnings and momentum; Holding & Investment for flow into large-cap conglomerates.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 for hold above the 20‑day moving average as confirmation of the risk‑on trend and a clean breakout above the recent swing high for extension; catalysts: CBRT commentary, global risk sentiment, Q4 earnings across banks and industrials.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow volatility and unanimous sector gains set a Risk‑On tape; banks and large holdings are the obvious leaders with autos and defense names providing momentum. Key risk is any global risk shock that flips sentiment—keep stops and favor high‑quality cyclicals on dips."
