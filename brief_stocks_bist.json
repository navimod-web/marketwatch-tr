Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanks show the only broad positive sector return but participation is uneven; focus on large-cap balance-sheet plays. AKBNK (1W: +2.98% | 1M: +14.94%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +0.13% | 1M: +5.77%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: -1.94% | 1M: +12.43%) CORRECTION, TSKB (1W: -8.94% | 1M: -2.56%) BELOW TREND.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry is bifurcated — exporters and select steel names outperform while auto and domestic cyclicals fade short term. EREGL (1W: +9.90% | 1M: +15.87%) ABOVE TREND, KRDMD (1W: +2.33% | 1M: +9.86%) ABOVE TREND, VESTL (1W: -9.79% | 1M: -3.55%) BELOW TREND, FROTO (1W: -6.42% | 1M: +10.95%) CORRECTION.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy names show dispersion — a couple of strong metals/chemicals rallied while specialty chemicals and refiners lag. TRALT (1W: +13.07% | 1M: +13.17%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +12.32% | 1M: +14.86%) ABOVE TREND, TUPRS (1W: +0.91% | 1M: -2.20%) RECOVERY, SASA (1W: -9.09% | 1M: -4.00%) BELOW TREND.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nNeutral tactical stance: overweight high-quality banks and select industrial exporters, underweight transportation and weak tech names; keep cash buffer for continued narrow breadth. Trim positions showing 1W weakness despite 1M strength.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nEREGL (1W: +9.90% | 1M: +15.87%) ABOVE TREND, TRALT (1W: +13.07% | 1M: +13.17%) ABOVE TREND, AKBNK (1W: +2.98% | 1M: +14.94%) ABOVE TREND, THYAO (1W: -10.58% | 1M: +3.09%) CORRECTION.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance for leadership confirmation, Transportation for downside risk and flow reversal, Energy & Chemicals for dispersion and earnings/catalyst-driven moves.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 near key technical band — support ~2,350 and resistance ~2,600; sustained close above resistance would signal leadership expansion, break below support would deepen the rotation. Macro and earnings beats/misses, FX moves, and regional geopolitics remain primary triggers.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNEUTRAL regime: normal volatility (26.0%) but extremely narrow participation (1/8 sectors positive). Trade selectively — favor large-cap banks and export-oriented industrials, underweight transportation and weak momentum tech/chemical names; monitor breadth and XU100 support/resistance for conviction changes."
