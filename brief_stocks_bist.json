  "content": "## MARKET OVERVIEW\n\n1. What is the Current Market Regime?\nCAUTION — low volatility (Vol: 12.2%) but extremely narrow participation with breadth 0/8 sectors positive; regime flag: CAUTION. Market is calm but fragile; any macro shock could force a broad pullback.\n\n2. Which sectors are leading?\nConstruction & REIT and Holding & Investment are the least weak despite negative breadth; Construction: EKGYO (1W: -0.10% | 1M: -4.55%) BELOW TREND, Holding: SAHOL (1W: -0.30% | 1M: +2.50%) CORRECTION. These are relative leaders on a down tape, not conviction buys.\n\n3. Which sectors are lagging?\nTechnology & Telecom and Banking are biggest drags; Tech: TCELL (1W: -3.80% | 1M: +2.31%) CORRECTION, KONTR (1W: -10.22% | 1M: -66.08%) BELOW TREND. Banking: ISCTR (1W: -3.98% | 1M: -0.52%) BELOW TREND — high beta exposure should be trimmed.\n\n## STOCK PERFORMANCE\n\n4. Top Performing Stocks?\nGUBRF (1W: +5.47% | 1M: +12.55%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: +3.85% | 1M: +20.50%) ABOVE TREND, HALKB (1W: +3.21% | 1M: +4.72%) ABOVE TREND, TAVHL (1W: +1.94% | 1M: +8.72%) ABOVE TREND, SOKM (1W: +0.70% | 1M: +9.67%) ABOVE TREND.\n\n5. Worst Performing Stocks?\nKONTR (1W: -10.22% | 1M: -66.08%) BELOW TREND, TRALT (1W: -7.38% | 1M: +16.31%) CORRECTION, PGSUS (1W: -6.69% | 1M: -2.79%) BELOW TREND, KRDMD (1W: -6.61% | 1M: +1.44%) CORRECTION, TSKB (1W: -5.25% | 1M: -4.59%) BELOW TREND.\n\n6. Momentum Stocks?\nUpside momentum centered on GUBRF (1W: +5.47% | 1M: +12.55%) ABOVE TREND and ASELS (1W: +3.85% | 1M: +20.50%) ABOVE TREND; downside momentum driven by KONTR (1W: -10.22% | 1M: -66.08%) BELOW TREND and TRALT (1W: -7.38% | 1M: +16.31%) CORRECTION.\n\n## SECTOR OUTLOOK\n\n7. Banking Sector Outlook?\nDefensive posture advised — HALKB outperforms while major names are under pressure: AKBNK (1W: -4.60% | 1M: +7.41%) CORRECTION, GARAN (1W: -1.81% | 1M: +1.80%) CORRECTION, ISCTR (1W: -3.98% | 1M: -0.52%) BELOW TREND, YKBNK (1W: -4.03% | 1M: +1.25%) CORRECTION, TSKB (1W: -5.25% | 1M: -4.59%) BELOW TREND.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nMixed with tactical longs in defense/defense-related names but broad weakness elsewhere: ASELS (1W: +3.85% | 1M: +20.50%) ABOVE TREND, TOASO (1W: +0.49% | 1M: +7.79%) ABOVE TREND, VESTL (1W: -4.16% | 1M: -9.53%) BELOW TREND, EREGL (1W: -2.88% | 1M: -0.92%) BELOW TREND, KRDMD (1W: -6.61% | 1M: +1.44%) CORRECTION.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nVolatility within the group; GUBRF leads while majors show correction risk: GUBRF (1W: +5.47% | 1M: +12.55%) ABOVE TREND, TRALT (1W: -7.38% | 1M: +16.31%) CORRECTION, TUPRS (1W: -1.40% | 1M: -6.01%) BELOW TREND, SASA (1W: -0.36% | 1M: -5.14%) BELOW TREND.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nExercise caution: reduce net beta and harvest short-term gains in stretched winners; add selectively to high-quant/confirmed leaders (GUBRF, ASELS, HALKB) while keeping cash for a breadth recovery. Avoid rebuilding exposure to weak, high-volatility tech names until participation improves.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nGUBRF (1W: +5.47% | 1M: +12.55%) ABOVE TREND for follow-through, ASELS (1W: +3.85% | 1M: +20.50%) ABOVE TREND for momentum, KONTR (1W: -10.22% | 1M: -66.08%) BELOW TREND for downside risk, TRALT (1W: -7.38% | 1M: +16.31%) CORRECTION for mean-reversion. Monitor AKBNK (1W: -4.60% | 1M: +7.41%) CORRECTION as a bank bellwether.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking (systemic weight and headline sensitivity) and Energy & Chemicals (big swings in GUBRF/TRALT), plus Technology & Telecom for downside spillover. Watch whether breadth moves above 3/8 to signal regime shift.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch breadth (>3/8) and USD/TRY moves as primary triggers; central bank communication, year-end flows and corporate guidance are catalysts that could flip the cautious regime. Short-term risk: any shock that breaks the calm low-volatility environment will rapidly widen losses given the current narrow participation.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow volatility but zero-sector breadth leaves markets in a CAUTION regime; macro calm masks concentrated winners (GUBRF, ASELS, HALKB) and deep losers (KONTR, TRALT). Stay defensively positioned, trim high-beta tech and transportation exposure, and add selectively to confirmed leaders if breadth improves."
