Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry mixed with selective winners; EREGL (1W: +1.62% | 1M: +12.33%) ABOVE TREND and ASELS (1W: +3.64% | 1M: +4.33%) ABOVE TREND lead, while FROTO (1W: -5.97% | 1M: +16.75%) is in CORRECTION — watch earnings/capex signals.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy shows bifurcation: TRMET (1W: +11.35% | 1M: +17.12%) ABOVE TREND and TRALT (1W: +8.45% | 1M: +15.82%) ABOVE TREND are outperformers, TUPRS (1W: +0.00% | 1M: -2.25%) NEUTRAL and PETKM (1W: -9.24% | 1M: -2.19%) BELOW TREND lag — volatility tied to oil and petrochemical margins.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nMaintain neutral net exposure: trim weakest cyclicals (Transportation, some HoldCos) and overweight high-conviction momentum names (TRMET, TRALT, ENKAI) and selective banks (YKBNK); keep liquidity for volatility-driven entries.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nTRMET (1W: +11.35% | 1M: +17.12%) ABOVE TREND on momentum breakouts, TRALT (1W: +8.45% | 1M: +15.82%) ABOVE TREND for follow-through, ENKAI (1W: +0.89% | 1M: +24.16%) ABOVE TREND as a quant leader, THYAO (1W: -7.84% | 1M: +7.19%) CORRECTION for recovery or further downside.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nEnergy & Chemicals for continuation or reversal of the recent leadership, Banking for selective spread and liquidity signals, Transportation for downside risk and earnings/capacity catalysts.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 reaction to recent lows and prior resistance (watch for a clear break or hold before rotating risk on); key catalysts are CBRT commentary, FX moves, oil prices and next tranche of corporate results — adjust positions on confirmed trend breaks.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNeutral regime: normal volatility but zero sector breadth — market lacks conviction. Look to add to proven momentum winners (TRMET/TRALT/ENKAI) and selective banks, while trimming transport and holding exposures given concentrated downside risk."
