Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanking is leading and confirming the move: ISCTR (1W: +8.61% | 1M: +25.60%) ABOVE TREND, AKBNK (1W: +5.78% | 1M: +20.11%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +3.88% | 1M: +11.28%) ABOVE TREND; favor high-beta names HALKB and VAKBN for continued catch-up.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry is constructive: FROTO (1W: +11.50% | 1M: +23.68%) ABOVE TREND, TOASO (1W: +7.80% | 1M: +18.88%) ABOVE TREND, EREGL (1W: +1.93% | 1M: +16.09%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: +4.95% | 1M: -0.08%) RECOVERY — watch ASELS for short-term bounce confirmation.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy is broadly bid but with dispersion: TRALT (1W: +14.56% | 1M: +17.00%) ABOVE TREND, SASA (1W: +11.57% | 1M: +15.38%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +9.71% | 1M: +17.24%) ABOVE TREND, TUPRS (1W: -0.63% | 1M: +1.37%) CORRECTION; prefer specialty chemicals and select refiner trades only on reversion tests.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk-ON stance: overweight Banking, select Tech and cyclical Industrials (FROTO, TOASO), and high-quant Retail names; trim unconfirmed Energy laggards like TUPRS and take profits where 1W >> 1M momentum has run (re-balance into names with more room). Maintain stop discipline for momentum names and size positions for potential mean-reversion.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nVAKBN (1W: +13.27% | 1M: +31.93%) ABOVE TREND for momentum and flow, TRALT (1W: +14.56% | 1M: +17.00%) ABOVE TREND for sector leadership, FROTO (1W: +11.50% | 1M: +23.68%) ABOVE TREND for cyclicals, TCELL (1W: +9.62% | 1M: +20.83%) ABOVE TREND for tech-driven upside.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking (continued leadership and liquidity), Energy & Chemicals (watch dispersion and TUPRS correction), Technology (follow earnings/flows into TCELL and KONTR).\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 for continuation vs a 3-5% pullback as the first risk signal; key catalysts are CBRT comments, domestic CPI prints, foreign fund flows and commodity/energy price moves. Watch earnings updates and quant signals (ENKAI, GUBRF) for re-allocation triggers.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow volatility RISK-ON market with unanimous sector breadth and clear leadership in Banking, Tech and selective Energy/chemicals. Trade overweight cyclical and high-quant retail/banking names while respecting stretched momentum and TUPRS as a near-term caution."
