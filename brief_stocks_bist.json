Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanking is the tactical leader; AKBNK (1W: +6.97% | 1M: +11.04%) ABOVE TREND, GARAN (1W: +6.29% | 1M: +6.22%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: +8.44% | 1M: +4.05%) ABOVE TREND and YKBNK (1W: +8.23% | 1M: +7.86%) ABOVE TREND show confirmed strength—overweight selective bank exposure.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy Industry is firing on all cylinders: ASELS (1W: +16.29% | 1M: +36.56%) ABOVE TREND, TOASO (1W: +11.93% | 1M: +18.74%) ABOVE TREND and FROTO (1W: +7.91% | 1M: +8.20%) ABOVE TREND offer cyclicality play with momentum; monitor VESTL (1W: +3.31% | 1M: -7.58%) RECOVERY for weaker industrials.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy & Chemicals are participating but mixed; TUPRS (1W: +9.23% | 1M: +1.21%) ABOVE TREND and TRMET (1W: +10.04% | 1M: +14.98%) ABOVE TREND lead, while OYAKC (1W: +3.72% | 1M: -3.31%) RECOVERY and HEKTS (1W: +4.59% | 1M: -0.31%) RECOVERY need confirmation.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk-on tactical stance: overweight Banking, Heavy Industry and select Retail; trim lagging Technology & Telecom exposure and keep small cash buffer for mean-reversion. Use size to lock in profits in extreme movers (ASELS, HALKB) and rotate into high-quality mid-momentum names (TRMET, MGROS).\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nASELS (1W: +16.29% | 1M: +36.56%) ABOVE TREND for momentum continuation, HALKB (1W: +15.71% | 1M: +13.58%) ABOVE TREND for bank leadership, TOASO (1W: +11.93% | 1M: +18.74%) ABOVE TREND for auto cycle, TUPRS (1W: +9.23% | 1M: +1.21%) ABOVE TREND for energy flow, KONTR (1W: -6.88% | 1M: -34.20%) BELOW TREND as a watch for capitulation or bounce.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance and Heavy Industry for leadership continuation; Energy & Chemicals for commodity/cost-driven moves and rotation opportunities.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 momentum: watch for continuation above recent highs and maintain support at short-term moving averages; key catalysts are domestic CPI, CBRT communication, USD/TRY moves and global risk sentiment shifts. Earnings updates, liquidity flows and any fiscal announcements will be immediate triggers for sector rotation.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility RISK-ON market with unanimous sector breadth and clear leadership in Banking and Heavy Industry; ASELS and HALKB are the most pronounced momentum names. Strategy: overweight cyclicals and banks, trim weak tech positions, and monitor macro catalysts (CPI, CBRT, USD/TRY) for rotation risk."
