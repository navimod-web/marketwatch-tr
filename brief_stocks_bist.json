Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk‑on stance: overweight Energy & Chemicals, Construction and Retail cyclicals; trim or selectively hedge positions in short‑lived momentum names after strong runs and hold high-quality banks (AKBNK, ISCTR) for beta management.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nGUBRF (1W: +24.20% | 1M: +45.45%) ABOVE TREND for continuation or profit-taking, TUPRS (1W: +9.54% | 1M: +32.28%) ABOVE TREND on oil moves, TCELL (1W: +9.86% | 1M: +23.36%) ABOVE TREND for sector flows, ENKAI (1W: +13.11% | 1M: +17.73%) ABOVE TREND for construction momentum.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nEnergy & Chemicals for commodity-driven extensions, Construction & REIT for domestic cyclical strength, Retail & Food for consumer demand resilience.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 near recent breakout and maintain stops on winners; key catalysts are domestic macro (inflation and CBRT communications), Q4 earnings flow, and global risk appetite/oil price moves that will steer Energy and Industrial performance.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK‑ON market with low volatility and unanimous sector participation; Energy & Chemicals, Construction and Retail lead. Opportunities in cyclicals; watch for profit-taking in extreme single-stock rallies and macro/currency or earnings surprises that could rapidly change sentiment."
