Favored on low vol, improving loan sentiment and strong relative performance.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry shows leadership but with dispersion: EREGL (1W: +3.84% | 1M: +12.00%) ABOVE TREND and TOASO (1W: +4.69% | 1M: +22.21%) ABOVE TREND, while FROTO (1W: -0.28% | 1M: +10.11%) CORRECTION and ASELS (1W: -2.75% | 1M: +33.85%) CORRECTION merit watch for mean-reversion or consolidation.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy is the top thematic winner — TRMET (1W: +9.49% | 1M: +25.67%) ABOVE TREND, GUBRF (1W: +22.56% | 1M: +28.35%) ABOVE TREND and TUPRS (1W: +1.48% | 1M: +20.11%) ABOVE TREND. Momentum intact; commodity price moves and refining margins remain primary drivers.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk-on stance: overweight Banking & Finance and Energy & Chemicals, add selective Heavy Industry and Transportation exposure; trim high-valuation, short-term underperformers in Retail & Food and weak Technology (KONTR). Keep stops tight on names showing 1W weakness after strong 1M runs.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nGUBRF (1W: +22.56% | 1M: +28.35%) ABOVE TREND for momentum continuation; HALKB (1W: +10.29% | 1M: +21.48%) ABOVE TREND for bank flow; TRMET (1W: +9.49% | 1M: +25.67%) ABOVE TREND and SOKM (1W: +7.01% | 1M: +22.75%) ABOVE TREND for earnings/volume cues. Monitor KONTR (1W: -3.96% | 1M: -18.16%) BELOW TREND for downside risk.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nEnergy & Chemicals and Banking & Finance for continuation of leadership; Retail & Food for potential catch-up or further profit-taking. Watch Transportation for sensitivity to travel demand data.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction to global risk sentiment and domestic rate guidance; support sits at the recent weekly consolidation low and the 50-day moving average, resistance at YTD highs — breaches will dictate follow-through. Key catalysts: CBRT commentary, US real rates, commodity price moves and Q4 corporate updates.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility, risk-on market with 7/8 sectors positive; Energy & Chemicals and Banks are the clear leaders while Retail shows short-term weakness. Overweight cyclicals and banks, monitor earnings and macro triggers for signs of rotation or profit-taking."
