Industrial Sector Outlook?**\nHeavy Industry shows bifurcation: EREGL (1W: +5.87% | 1M: +14.36%) ABOVE TREND is a momentum leader while ARCLK (1W: -7.11% | 1M: +5.13%) CORRECTION and FROTO (1W: -5.49% | 1M: +7.23%) CORRECTION are under pressure.\n\n**9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?**\nEnergy is polarized: TRMET (1W: +8.77% | 1M: +17.19%) ABOVE TREND and TRALT (1W: +8.46% | 1M: +11.19%) ABOVE TREND outperform while SASA (1W: -8.85% | 1M: -4.05%) BELOW TREND and HEKTS (1W: -11.53% | 1M: -6.12%) BELOW TREND drag the group.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n**10. Portfolio Recommendation?**\nNeutral tactical stance: trim weak momentum losers and idiosyncratic risk (HEKTS, TSKB, SASA, TKFEN) and selectively add to high-quant leaders and momentum winners (TRMET, TRALT, EREGL, AKBNK) while keeping overall beta contained given narrow breadth.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n**11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?**\nTRMET (1W: +8.77% | 1M: +17.19%) ABOVE TREND for momentum follow-through; EREGL (1W: +5.87% | 1M: +14.36%) ABOVE TREND for cyclicals; AKBNK (1W: +0.55% | 1M: +14.39%) ABOVE TREND for banking flow; TKFEN (1W: -9.47% | 1M: +4.62%) CORRECTION as a potential mean-reversion candidate.\n\n**12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?**\nBanking & Finance for liquidity-led moves, Energy & Chemicals for commodity/earnings swings, Heavy Industry for momentum continuation or reversal.\n\n**13. Key Levels & Triggers?**\nWatch XU100 reaction to 20-day vs 50-day moving averages (hold 20-day = risk-on; failure to hold 50-day = broader risk-off); catalysts: CBRT guidance, FX moves, global oil/commodity shifts, and company-level earnings/flows.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNEUTRAL market: normal volatility (26.0%) but no sector breadth (0/8), so index strength is narrow. Trade selectively: favor high-quant and momentum leaders (TRMET, TRALT, EREGL, AKBNK) and trim idiosyncratic weak names (HEKTS, TSKB, SASA) until breadth returns."
