Portfolio Recommendation?\nMaintain neutral weights; trim high-beta/largest laggards (transportation, select holding names) and favor high-quant defensive longs (ENKAI, SOKM, MGROS, BIMAS, VAKBN) and select industrials with confirmed above-trend status.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nTRMET (1W: +8.31% | 1M: +17.39%) ABOVE TREND; TAVHL (1W: -10.22% | 1M: +1.97%) CORRECTION; ISCTR (1W: -9.26% | 1M: +10.76%) CORRECTION; TOASO (1W: +0.08% | 1M: +15.95%) ABOVE TREND.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nTransportation for continued volatility; Energy & Chemicals for rotational follow-through; Retail & Food for defensive flows and quant-driven buying.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 short-term technical pivots (hold near the recent 1-month lows; break below = defensive reweight, reclaiming the monthly high = risk-on re-entry). Catalysts: CBRT commentary and FX moves, US macro (CPI/PMI), bank and energy earnings, and any company-specific operational updates.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nNeutral volatility environment but breadth is alarmingly weak (0/8 sectors positive), suggesting risk is concentrated and sentiment fragile; favor high-quant defensive names and selective above-trend industrials while trimming transportation and weak holding/energy names ahead of macro and earnings catalysts."
