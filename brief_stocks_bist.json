Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanks are under short-term pressure after a pullback despite healthy 1M gains; AKBNK (1W: -5.00% | 1M: +13.67%) CORRECTION, GARAN (1W: -5.94% | 1M: +6.59%) CORRECTION, ISCTR (1W: -3.04% | 1M: +17.16%) CORRECTION — watch relative strength in HALKB (1W: +2.85% | 1M: +12.57%) ABOVE TREND for rotation signals.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy industry shows constructive breadth: EREGL (1W: +1.53% | 1M: +17.36%) ABOVE TREND, ARCLK (1W: +4.06% | 1M: +12.12%) ABOVE TREND, while autos show mixed pullbacks—TOASO (1W: -3.77% | 1M: +11.60%) CORRECTION, FROTO (1W: -0.52% | 1M: +17.31%) CORRECTION.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy is bifurcated: TRALT (1W: +6.24% | 1M: +11.61%) ABOVE TREND, PETKM (1W: +2.94% | 1M: +11.49%) ABOVE TREND and GUBRF (1W: +2.67% | 1M: +36.08%) ABOVE TREND versus TUPRS (1W: -8.38% | 1M: +5.62%) CORRECTION and OYAKC (1W: -3.91% | 1M: +5.60%) CORRECTION — earnings, margins and oil moves are key.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nModestly overweight cyclicals and high-quant retail/industrial names while trimming consensus bank and holding exposure; keep size discipline as participation is moderate and rallies need follow-through. Use TUPRS and bank pullbacks as selective buy-on-weakness setups, but favor names with confirmed ABOVE TREND momentum.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nTHYAO (1W: +4.47% | 1M: +14.24%) ABOVE TREND for travel recovery flow, TRALT (1W: +6.24% | 1M: +11.61%) ABOVE TREND for energy momentum, TUPRS (1W: -8.38% | 1M: +5.62%) CORRECTION for mean-reversion, AKBNK (1W: -5.00% | 1M: +13.67%) CORRECTION for bank sentiment, KONTR (1W: +5.20% | 1M: -0.39%) RECOVERY for tech rotation.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nRetail & Food for defensive consumption strength and high quant scores, Energy & Chemicals for volatility-driven opportunities, and Banking for directional confirmation after the weekly pullback.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 reaction to last week's high and low: a sustained break above the 1-month high would confirm continuation of the risk-on move, while a decisive break below last week's low would shift flows into risk-off. Watch oil prices, global risk sentiment and local liquidity/cb communications as primary catalysts.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility RISK-ON market with mixed breadth; cyclical names in tech, transport and retail are leading while banks and holdings lag after profit-taking. Opportunity exists to add momentum leaders (TRALT, THYAO, TKFEN) and selectively buy corrections in TUPRS and large banks if macro catalysts align, but keep stops tight given moderate participation."
