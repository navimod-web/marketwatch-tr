ASELS (1W: +7.11% | 1M: +22.55%) ABOVE TREND and TOASO (1W: +3.22% | 1M: +9.12%) ABOVE TREND lead, while EREGL (1W: -2.93% | 1M: -0.17%) BELOW TREND and VESTL (1W: -4.39% | 1M: -10.56%) BELOW TREND lag.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy shows selective strength led by refiners and metal recycling names; sector 1W: +1.40%. GUBRF (1W: +10.93% | 1M: +13.18%) ABOVE TREND, TRALT (1W: +3.98% | 1M: +16.58%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +3.76% | 1M: +5.91%) ABOVE TREND, while TUPRS (1W: +0.27% | 1M: -4.69%) RECOVERY is less convincing.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nAdopt a cautious, high-conviction stance: overweight leading pockets in Construction & REIT and selective Energy names, trim broad banking/tech exposure and low-conviction holdings. Keep liquidity for rotation risk and tighten stop-losses on high-volatility laggards.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nWatch GUBRF (1W: +10.93% | 1M: +13.18%) ABOVE TREND for follow-through, ASELS (1W: +7.11% | 1M: +22.55%) ABOVE TREND for momentum continuation, KONTR (1W: -10.89% | 1M: -66.72%) BELOW TREND for volatility and short-cover risk, AKBNK (1W: -3.55% | 1M: +8.63%) CORRECTION for bank flows, and EKGYO (1W: +3.55% | 1M: -0.10%) RECOVERY for short-term bounce.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nMonitor Construction & REIT and Energy & Chemicals for continuation, and Technology & Telecom for downside risk and volatility spillovers. Pay attention to banking flows as a barometer for market breadth.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 trading range behavior around this week's highs and lows for confirmation of breadth expansion, with catalysts being FX moves, central bank commentary, Q4 earnings and commodity price swings. Market direction will hinge on whether leaders sustain gains and whether breadth widens beyond current 2/8.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nCautionary environment: low volatility but narrow breadth (Vol 13.1%, breadth 2/8), favouring high-conviction longs in Construction & REIT and selective Energy while trimming broad-cap financial and tech exposure. Key risk is sudden breadth deterioration as laggards resume weak flows; key opportunity is exploiting momentum in outliers like GUBRF and ASELS."
