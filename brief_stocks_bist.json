Banking Sector Outlook?\nBanks show mild participation; HALKB (1W: +6.90% | 1M: +11.96%) ABOVE TREND leads while AKBNK (1W: +0.41% | 1M: +7.50%) ABOVE TREND is steady and GARAN (1W: -2.81% | 1M: +4.15%) CORRECTION needs to re-establish momentum.\n\n8. Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHeavy Industry remains constructive: ASELS (1W: +21.63% | 1M: +36.05%) ABOVE TREND, TOASO (1W: +6.67% | 1M: +17.95%) ABOVE TREND and EREGL (1W: +1.82% | 1M: +2.15%) ABOVE TREND support cyclical positioning.\n\n9.

Portfolio Recommendation?\nOverweight Retail & Food and select Heavy Industry names to ride momentum; trim Technology & Telecom exposure and avoid weak chemicals like SASA until technical recovery. Manage position sizes for large single-stock moves (ASELS, SASA).\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nASELS (1W: +21.63% | 1M: +36.05%) ABOVE TREND, BIMAS (1W: +11.33% | 1M: +14.42%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +10.28% | 1M: +17.46%) ABOVE TREND, KONTR (1W: -11.78% | 1M: -27.91%) BELOW TREND, SASA (1W: -18.34% | 1M: -18.06%) BELOW TREND.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nRetail & Food and Heavy Industry for upside continuation; Technology & Telecom for downside risk and potential volatility spillover.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction to global rate headlines, US CPI and USD/TRY; confirmation above recent highs would validate RISK-ON, while a break on liquidity or FX shock would flip flows quickly.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK-ON market: low vol (15.8%) and 6/8 sectors positive with clear leadership from Retail & Food and Heavy Industry (ASELS, MGROS, BIMAS). Opportunities in cyclicals; key risk remains concentrated downside in weak tech/chemicals (KONTR, SASA) that could trigger short-term reversals."
