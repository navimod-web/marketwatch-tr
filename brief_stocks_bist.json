Industrial Sector Outlook?\nHealthy cyclicals with idiosyncratic risk: EREGL (1W: +0.77% | 1M: +17.43%) ABOVE TREND, FROTO (1W: +2.77% | 1M: +18.09%) ABOVE TREND and TOASO (1W: +1.41% | 1M: +15.23%) ABOVE TREND outperform, but ASELS (1W: -10.66% | 1M: +8.16%) CORRECTION highlights headline-driven volatility.\n\n9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nUnder pressure and volatile: SISE (1W: +3.84% | 1M: +19.21%) ABOVE TREND is a standout, while TUPRS (1W: -8.82% | 1M: +13.76%) CORRECTION, OYAKC (1W: -5.40% | 1M: +9.09%) CORRECTION, TRMET (1W: -14.66% | 1M: +12.09%) CORRECTION and TRALT (1W: -22.23% | 1M: +2.72%) CORRECTION demand active risk control.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nTilt pro-cyclical: overweight Transportation, Construction and top Retail longs while trimming holdings in Energy & Chemicals and large holding names that underperformed. Keep position sizes disciplined and use recent weakness in select banks and energy names as tactical entry points with tight stop-losses.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nTKFEN (1W: +7.78% | 1M: +12.60%) ABOVE TREND for momentum continuation, TAVHL (1W: +4.20% | 1M: +11.97%) ABOVE TREND for travel demand, TUPRS (1W: -8.82% | 1M: +13.76%) CORRECTION for mean-reversion or further downside, AKBNK (1W: -5.17% | 1M: +16.74%) CORRECTION for banking flow shifts.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nTransportation for momentum and earnings/capacity cues, Energy & Chemicals for margin and oil-price driven volatility, and Banking for rate/FX sensitivity and earnings whispers. Monitor retail for consumer resilience signals.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nVolatility remains low at 19.9% — supportive for risk assets; watch USD/TRY moves, global risk sentiment and local macro prints (CPI, policy comments) as primary triggers. Index reaction to those headlines will determine whether risk-on expands (breakout) or narrows into select winners (pullback).\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility, risk-on backdrop with mixed breadth favors cyclical, high-beta BIST50 names in Transportation, Construction and Retail while Energy, Holding and parts of Banking are correcting. Trade selectively: lean into confirmed ABOVE TREND names and use sharp corrections in energy/large caps for tactical opportunities with disciplined stops."
