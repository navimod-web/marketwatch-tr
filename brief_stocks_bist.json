Watch retail for short-term profit-taking despite strong 1M performance.\n\n## STOCK PERFORMANCE\n\n**4. Top Performing Stocks?**\nGUBRF (1W: +22.56% | 1M: +28.35%) ABOVE TREND, HALKB (1W: +10.29% | 1M: +21.48%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +9.49% | 1M: +25.67%) ABOVE TREND, OYAKC (1W: +7.81% | 1M: +12.67%) ABOVE TREND, VAKBN (1W: +7.36% | 1M: +15.18%) ABOVE TREND.\n\n**5.

Banking Sector Outlook?**\nBanks are running with strong breadth; AKBNK (1W: +5.27% | 1M: +12.88%) ABOVE TREND, ISCTR (1W: +7.19% | 1M: +10.79%) ABOVE TREND, HALKB (1W: +10.29% | 1M: +21.48%) ABOVE TREND. Favor overweight exposure to rate-sensitive names while monitoring NIM and FX transmission.\n\n**8. Industrial Sector Outlook?**\nHeavy industry showing gains but with rotations; EREGL (1W: +3.84% | 1M: +12.00%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: -2.75% | 1M: +33.85%) CORRECTION, FROTO (1W: -0.28% | 1M: +10.11%) CORRECTION. Select names remain attractive after recent runs; watch order flow and margin signals.\n\n**9. Energy & Chemicals Outlook?**\nClear leadership with broad strength: TUPRS (1W: +1.48% | 1M: +20.11%) ABOVE TREND, GUBRF (1W: +22.56% | 1M: +28.35%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +9.49% | 1M: +25.67%) ABOVE TREND. Momentum and commodity re-pricing support further upside, but monitor oil and feedstock moves.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n**10. Portfolio Recommendation?**\nRisk-on stance: overweight Banking & Finance and Energy & Chemicals, selectively add cyclicals (autos, steel) and top quant names, underweight defensive Retail names showing short-term profit-taking. Keep hedges for FX/rate headlines and trim positions that lose their 1W momentum.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n**11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?**\nGUBRF (1W: +22.56% | 1M: +28.35%) ABOVE TREND, HALKB (1W: +10.29% | 1M: +21.48%) ABOVE TREND, TRMET (1W: +9.49% | 1M: +25.67%) ABOVE TREND, SOKM (1W: +7.01% | 1M: +22.75%) ABOVE TREND. These names are catalysts for sector flows and may lead further rotation.\n\n**12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?**\nEnergy & Chemicals and Banking & Finance for continuation of the rally, and Retail & Food to monitor mean-reversion risk. Earnings, FX moves and local macro prints will drive intra-week sector shifts.\n\n**13. Key Levels & Triggers?**\nWatch XU100 for confirmation of the breakout vs its recent high and hold of the short-term (1W) moving average as immediate support; a decisive close below the weekly MA would warn of rotation. Key triggers: TRY moves, CBRT commentary, CPI and corporate earnings/fund flows.\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nLow volatility, broad participation: RISK-ON with Energy & Banking leading the rally and Retail showing short-term profit-taking. Trade with an overweight in cyclicals and banks, keep disciplined stops around weekly MAs given FX and rate sensitivities."
