Portfolio Recommendation?\nStay overweight cyclicals and banks while trimming isolated, structurally weaker tech names; prioritize high-quant retail and construction names. Use profits to add selectively to beaten-up quality names with strong 1M momentum (e.g., AKBNK, SAHOL) and keep cash for short-term pullbacks.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nAKBNK (1W: +14.19% | 1M: +23.74%) ABOVE TREND for follow-through; ENKAI (1W: +12.31% | 1M: +19.08%) ABOVE TREND for construction strength; SISE (1W: +10.85% | 1M: +15.89%) ABOVE TREND for reflation trade; ASELS (1W: -7.35% | 1M: +30.10%) CORRECTION as a volatility play.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking & Finance for leadership continuation and rate-sensitivity; Retail & Food for resilient consumer demand and strong quant scores. Monitor Energy & Chemicals for commodity-driven reversals.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 reaction at recent breakout and maintain stops on positions if market gives a 3-5% reversal; follow headline catalysts: Turkish CPI prints, CBRT signals, and company earnings/updates from banks and large holdings. Positive macro prints and stable FX should extend the current RISK-ON move; disappointing data will rapidly widen intra-week dispersion.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility RISK-ON market with 6/8 sectors positive; banks, holdings and retail are leading while energy and telecom show short-term weakness. Tactical bias: overweight cyclicals and high-quant retail/construction names, trim short-term laggards and size positions for potential mean-reversion in the most volatile names."
