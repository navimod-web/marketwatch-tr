Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 proximity to its 20-day trend for continuation; catalysts: Q4 earnings, CBRT or macro commentary, FX flows and commodity price moves that will re-rate banks, energy and industrials.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK-ON market with low volatility (Vol: 15.7%) and 7/8 sectors positive; leadership is broad across transportation, retail and banks. Trade overweight cyclicals and high-quant names (CCOLA, SOKM, TRMET) while defending against tech weakness (KONTR) and select chemical routs (SASA)."
