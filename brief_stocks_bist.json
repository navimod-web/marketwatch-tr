Keep cash buffer for volatility spikes and trim positions with negative 1W and 1M confirmation.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nTRALT (1W: +12.59% | 1M: +5.87%) ABOVE TREND for continuation; VAKBN (1W: +5.00% | 1M: +16.22%) ABOVE TREND on bank flows; AKBNK (1W: +3.24% | 1M: +15.99%) ABOVE TREND for sector momentum; TUPRS (1W: -6.58% | 1M: -9.95%) BELOW TREND as a downside-reversion candidate; KONTR (1W: -4.25% | 1M: -53.51%) BELOW TREND for volatility watch.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nBanking (flow-driven) and Transportation (seasonal demand) plus Retail (earnings/consumption sensitivity).\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nMonitor XU100 reaction around near-term highs for continuation and prior support for risk-off flips; key catalysts: CBRT communications, domestic macro prints (inflation, industrial production), global risk sentiment and oil moves that will drive Energy & Chemicals.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nRISK-ON tape with low volatility but only moderate sector participation; banks and transportation are driving leadership while Energy and Tech lag. Tactical overweight in banking, select industrials and retail; keep stops on names showing confirmed 1W and 1M weakness."
