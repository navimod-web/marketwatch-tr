Stocks to Watch Next Week?**\nTRALT (1W: +22.29% | 1M: +22.23%) ABOVE TREND for continuation/parabolic risk, TRMET (1W: +9.75% | 1M: +12.35%) ABOVE TREND, HALKB (1W: +7.83% | 1M: +24.85%) ABOVE TREND, ASELS (1W: +5.92% | 1M: +20.38%) ABOVE TREND, KONTR (1W: -8.87% | 1M: -63.43%) BELOW TREND for downside follow-through.\n\n**12.
