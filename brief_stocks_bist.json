Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nHeavy Industry, Banking & Finance, and Construction & REIT — watch leadership sustainability and whether weak sectors continue to bleed or stabilize.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 behavior around the 20-day moving average as the first support/inflection; catalysts: CBRT/comments on policy, global risk sentiment, and Q1 earnings flow that will drive sector rotation.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility, risk-on tape with narrow participation: Heavy Industry and select banks lead while Technology, Retail and Holdings lag. Trade cyclicals on strength, add selectively on pullbacks, and use CBRT/commentary and Q1 results as triggers to rotate exposures."
