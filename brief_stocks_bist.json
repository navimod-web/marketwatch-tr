Energy & Chemicals Outlook?\nEnergy & Chemicals are constructive: SASA (1W: +9.49% | 1M: +15.90%) ABOVE TREND, TRALT (1W: +11.19% | 1M: +12.92%) ABOVE TREND, TUPRS (1W: +1.68% | 1M: +0.45%) ABOVE TREND, SISE (1W: +5.22% | 1M: +28.09%) ABOVE TREND. Watch commodity/FX sensitivity for volatility around macro prints.\n\n## PORTFOLIO STRATEGY\n\n10. Portfolio Recommendation?\nRisk-on stance: overweight cyclicals (Autos, Heavy Industry), select Tech & Banks; trim low-beta defensives if needed. Keep cash buffer for short-term profit-taking and monitor FX/liquidity flow triggers.\n\n## NEXT WEEK OUTLOOK\n\n11. Stocks to Watch Next Week?\nFROTO (1W: +12.48% | 1M: +27.42%) ABOVE TREND for momentum continuation; TCELL (1W: +8.97% | 1M: +20.40%) ABOVE TREND on sector rotation; VAKBN (1W: +10.34% | 1M: +27.68%) ABOVE TREND for bank-flow leadership; SASA (1W: +9.49% | 1M: +15.90%) ABOVE TREND for commodity sensitivity.\n\n12. Sectors to Watch Next Week?\nTechnology & Telecom for momentum confirmation; Banking & Finance for rate/FX sensitivity and flows; Heavy Industry for cyclicals and earnings updates.\n\n13. Key Levels & Triggers?\nWatch XU100 near its 20-day MA for pullback support and recent highs for resistance; major catalysts are domestic CBRT communications, FX liquidity/flow headlines, US PMI/CPI prints and oil moves. Earnings and sector-specific news (auto orders, polymer margins) are likely short-term triggers.\n\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLow-volatility, full-breadth RISK-ON market: cyclicals, tech and banks leading with broad confirmation. Opportunity in high-momentum names (FROTO, TCELL, VAKBN, SASA) but manage position sizes around FX and macro catalysts."
